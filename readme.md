NOTE: The following readme is temporarily unfinished and unformatted. It is written from the perspective of a freelance web developer who has just landed a job designing a website for a co-working space company.

These are the notes I would take throughout this process.

~

This project is a website for a co-working company. The target users are partially the company itself but mainly the independent, professional individuals, who are looking for a space to do their work. The company wants the website to reflect their unique personality, that is luxurious, cool, high-end, welcoming, funky, local, fun, and less corporate than other companies in this field. They want to cater to more people than just people in tech and coders, opting to be accessible for more types of people such as artists, day traders, writers, - essentially any professional and independent individual. The company has also requested that the website reflects their amenities, those being their on-site coffee counter, communal AND private offices, high-speed internet, printing and faxing services, and their optional Thursday group activities.

Pages requested:
  landing page
    should feature the rest of the pages as items on a navbar
    user reviews around lower third of the page
    large splash images - mix of stock and provided by client
  contact page
  amenities page

Potential Users:

  Prospective clients:
    coders
    artists
    writers
    more traditional business people
    Companies

  Each requires:
    working spaces including desks, chairs
    the option to work privately of collaboratively
    an environment that helps them focus while also providing ways to relax
    internet

  Coders:
    whiteboards

  Artists:
    crafting spaces/materials

  Writers:
    printers

  Companies:
    dedicated group working areas

The site will likely be visited by a majority of people who are more technically inclined, but should still be simple enough and intuitive enough to be navigated by those less technically inclined.

The site should be very clear on:
  The features of the co-working space
  the pricing
  the type of people welcome to work there (all)
  the quality of the space and amenities

From what I can tell, the potential clients for this company won't be needing to use their website as a service, and will likely only use the website to find out information about the space, and sign up to become a member of the space. The site shouldn't need the potential customers to create an account for anything other than managing their payment method (changing payment methods/canceling their membership). If the company requests, a user forum could be added where their clients can converse with each other about topics relevant to the space, though the same could be accomplished by inviting customers to a slack channel once they become members. The latter option may be more ideal for the customers because many of them likely use slack already, and most people would probably prefer to not add another form of social media, especially with how limited the scope of possible connections would be (only other members of the space).

That being said I believe the main features of the site that are relevant to the potential customers are to accurately represent the space itself and make it easy to sign up. I can only do so much to make the space seem enticing to prospective customers, but if the space does not have a specific feature/amenity that said prospective client wants, I cannot do anything about that. That is why I have to make sure to list every single amenity that the space features, while still keeping the site easy to scan so that the customers can quickly find the information relevant to them.


EDIT:   
  The needs of companies vary from the needs of individuals. Likely they have their own way to manage the attendance of their employees, but a potential feature for managers would be an interface to manage their employees if needed.



"I am a artist (replace artist with literally any other professional), I want to be sure that this space will have other artists (professionals) like me, and cater to my unique needs so that I feel welcome and part of a community"


Research:

  The two website they linked both feature large images of the space itself, as well as a few images that are of the location of the space.

  A lot of these types of websites list the companies that work in their spaces, however this company is new and didnt mention and companies that work there yet.

  Multiple plans are offered for different sized businesses

  clean layouts, avoid clutter while still having a lot of information

  While doing research I need to remember to keep in mind the smaller size of the company that I am building this site for, they definitely appear have a smaller space than some of their competitors, seemingly have only one location, and are more focused on the sense of community and human element of the workspace.

  A lot of the other sites for larger companies have a very white layout, that to me conveys a corporate, sanitized, personality (I am also generally not a fan of all white layouts), I think that for this client a woodgrain background and earthy tones may be more suitable to convey their personality. Less is more though and the color white definitely has its place on a professional website.

  In the pictures the company sent me, they also appear to have quite a few plants throughout the space, further supporting my idea to have more of a nature feel to the website. I also notice a lot of pink, teal, and green in the space, so I think those would be good colors to use on the site.

  The color palette I'm thinking of using so far is pink, teal, green, brown and white.
